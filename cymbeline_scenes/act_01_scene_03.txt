SCENE III. Britain. A public place.

 Enter Cloten and two Lords.

FIRST LORD.
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath
made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in;
there’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

CLOTEN.
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] No, faith; not so much as his patience.

FIRST LORD.
Hurt him! His body’s a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a
throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] His steel was in debt; it went o’ th’ backside the town.

CLOTEN.
The villain would not stand me.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

FIRST LORD.
Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he added to your
having, gave you some ground.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] As many inches as you have oceans.
Puppies!

CLOTEN.
I would they had not come between us.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] So would I, till you had measur’d how long a fool you were
upon the ground.

CLOTEN.
And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn’d.

FIRST LORD.
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together;
she’s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt
her.

CLOTEN.
Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which
is no great hurt.

CLOTEN.
You’ll go with us?

FIRST LORD.
I’ll attend your lordship.

CLOTEN.
Nay, come, let’s go together.

SECOND LORD.
Well, my lord.

 [_Exeunt._]
