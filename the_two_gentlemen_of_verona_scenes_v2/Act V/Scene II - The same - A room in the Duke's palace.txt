ACT V


SCENE II. The same. A room in the Duke’s palace

Enter Thurio, Proteus and Julia.

THURIO.
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

PROTEUS.
O, sir, I find her milder than she was,
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

THURIO.
What? That my leg is too long?

PROTEUS.
No, that it is too little.

THURIO.
I’ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] But love will not be spurred to what it loathes.

THURIO.
What says she to my face?

PROTEUS.
She says it is a fair one.

THURIO.
Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

PROTEUS.
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
“Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes.”

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] ’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes,
For I had rather wink than look on them.

THURIO.
How likes she my discourse?

PROTEUS.
Ill, when you talk of war.

THURIO.
But well when I discourse of love and peace.

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

THURIO.
What says she to my valour?

PROTEUS.
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

THURIO.
What says she to my birth?

PROTEUS.
That you are well derived.

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] True, from a gentleman to a fool.

THURIO.
Considers she my possessions?

PROTEUS.
O, ay, and pities them.

THURIO.
Wherefore?

JULIA.
[_Aside_.] That such an ass should owe them.

PROTEUS.
That they are out by lease.

JULIA.
Here comes the Duke.

Enter Duke.

DUKE.
How now, Sir Proteus! How now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

THURIO.
Not I.

PROTEUS.
Nor I.

DUKE.
Saw you my daughter?

PROTEUS.
Neither.

DUKE.
Why then, she’s fled unto that peasant Valentine,
And Eglamour is in her company.
’Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both
As he in penance wandered through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she,
But, being masked, he was not sure of it.
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not.
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

[_Exit._]

THURIO.
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
I’ll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

[_Exit._]

PROTEUS.
And I will follow, more for Silvia’s love
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

[_Exit._]

JULIA.
And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.

[_Exit._]
