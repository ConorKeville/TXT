ACT II


SCENE II. Verona. A room in Julia’s house

Enter Proteus and Julia.

PROTEUS.
Have patience, gentle Julia.

JULIA.
I must, where is no remedy.

PROTEUS.
When possibly I can, I will return.

JULIA.
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake.

[_Gives him a ring._]

PROTEUS.
Why, then we’ll make exchange. Here, take you this.

[_Gives her a ring._]

JULIA.
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

PROTEUS.
Here is my hand for my true constancy.
And when that hour o’erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness.
My father stays my coming; answer not.
The tide is now—nay, not thy tide of tears,
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell.

[_Exit Julia._]

What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do. It cannot speak,
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

Enter Pantino.

PANTINO.
Sir Proteus, you are stayed for.

PROTEUS.
Go, I come, I come.
Alas, this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

[_Exeunt._]
